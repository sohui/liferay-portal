##
## Base Patterns
##

	#
	# Target "modern" JavaScript files only by first ignoring all ".js"
	# files and then un-ignoring the ".es.js" subset.
	#
	*.js
	!*.es.js

##
## Configuration Files
##

	#
	# Unignore configuration files because they should be treated as "modern"
	# despite not having an ".es.js" extension.
	#
	!.eslintrc.js
	!npmscripts.config.js

	#
	# Unlike the other configuration files (which can appear inside project
	# subdirectories), there should only ever be one global Prettier configuration
	# file at the top-level, so we do not use a recursive ("**/*") glob here.
	#
	!.prettierrc.js

##
## Generated Files
##

	#
	# For the most part, these are artifacts of our installation and build
	# processes and exist only as untracked files. A small number are committed
	# to the repository, but as they are generated files the linter should
	# not touch them.
	#
	*.soy.js
	build/**
	classes/**
	css/clay/**
	node_modules/**
	zippableResources/**

##
## Sample Files
##

	#
	# The few files here are provided for example purposes and are not actively
	# changed, so we exclude them from linting.
	#
	sdk/**
